# Fast Flow (NL) Concept

Fast Flow (NL) is a community to discuss and explore different concepts brought forward in the Team Topologies book by Matthew Skelton and Manuel Pais.

This group welcomes talks about socio-technical topics, Team Topologies, platform engineering, organisational design, domain-driven design, software architecture, strategy, Wardley mapping, event storming, developer experience and the human aspects of software engineering.

We're looking forward to building a vibrant, inclusive community which focuses on the human and organisational aspects of software delivery.

## Our approach to meetups

We approach our meetups not as a traditional ‘2 speakers and pizza’ meetup. Instead, we realise that this field of work is quickly evolving, and we’re learning as a group.

We approach our meetups as a collaborative event for intellectual discourse, where we share our own experiences, discuss topics and learn from each other. For some topics, you will have something to bring and share, for others, you will absorb and learn from others. Sometimes a discussion will be in a small group, sometimes in a plenary presentation.

Our meetup offers content formats that cater to this collaborative, interactive style, including open and self-organised conversations and discussions (offering attendees the opportunity to talk about anything they’d like), workshops, mapping sessions, and the more traditional curated talks. And although each meetup will go with the flow of whatever happens happens; we will set a structure for each meetup for planning and logistical purposes. 

Topics range widely, from highly technical to pure culture, covering the breadth of socio-technical topics. Our question for you, and ourselves, is to bring topics that have been lingering in your mind.
Preparing to participate
As you prepare to participate, we would like you to think about what you can bring to this meetup, or what you would like to learn. Bringing and sharing experiences can happen in a talk-with-a-slidedeck, but also in the form of a self-organised discussion with participants, a Wardley mapping session or workshop.

If, instead, you want to activate the hive mind of Fast Flow NL to help you solve a particular issues you’ve been struggling with, a self-organised discussion with participants or Wardley mapping session are great formats.

## Logistical and Catering Guidelines

To make our meetup welcoming to a broad range of people, we would like you to follow some logistical and catering guidelines:
- Make vegan and vegetarian dining options first-class citizens
- While we don’t mind the occasional pizza, we would like to offer our community  healthy sustenance.
- Offer a wide range of beverages, catering to drinks beyond the usual alcoholic and soft drink selection.
- We collect and share dietary information with you in advance and work with you to offer suitable catering options.
- Offer a location that is well-served by public transport and by car

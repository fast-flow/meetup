# Fast Flow meetup

We're a bunch of enthusiasts who like to talk about how organisational design impacts software architecture and delivery - and vice versa.

Inspired by Team Topologies, we've put together some resources to allow you to organise your own meetup to discuss some of the ideas around:

* Sociotechnical systems and Conway's Law
* Managing cognitive load for faster flow of features
* Platform engineering, organizational design, domain-driven design
* Software architecture and strategy
* Wardley mapping, event storming
* Developer experience and the human aspects of software engineering

To get started, you can read about the [concept](concept.md) here.
